# **Nivel-notes**

## A simple note-taking web-app written in Python using flask. Based on [Tech with Tim's tutorial on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dam0GPOAvVI)


## Issues :
* There is an error while signing up with an account for first time. User has to reload and login.
* Sometimes, the notes aren't added properly and on reloading, the same note is added twice
